# SPN Website

**IMPORTANT**: This is a repository related to the GPN18 version of SPN. It is
no longer maintained. See https://github.com/schlangenprogrammiernacht/spn-meta
for the GPN19 version!

This repository contains the website, the main user interface for players. It provides an IDE where players can develop their bot program. It also allows to simply watch the game (without login) and to check out the current highscores.
